# Quine McCluskey algorithm

This is the implementation of the Quine McCluskey algorithm in C++.

This project is a course project for CS3130 Electronic design automation. I got a quite well result on the first try, but soon I realized that there were many students, whose results were way better than mine. I use an aggressive greedy strategy to optimize the runtime and the result. Finally, I got a nice performance than the other students.

## Get started.

1. First, you need to download the verifier from [github](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc). Download and compile it and place the executable abc in the directory verifier.

2. Run `make` to compile our executable and run `make get_all_result` to execute all testcase in the [testcases](testcases).

3. Check my paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lmGZnTf4yrZGXXkqLPmlH5gW7t6Krg53/view?usp=sharing)
